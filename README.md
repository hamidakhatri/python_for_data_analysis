# Python for Data Analysis

This includes all my assignments and projects I completed in Python for Data Analysis course by Albany Can Code.

1. Partner collaboration between myself and my classmate having a conversation with each other and outputting the responses in the form of a list.

2. Home practice on operators and math functions.

3. Created a dictionary and manipulated data.

4. Created files and managed data.

5. Created lists and handled data.

6. Developed a math game.

7. Mid review on math functions, python basics, file handling, dictionary, and lists.

8. Final individual review: Built a User Program that created a bunch of options for the user and allowed them to pick what option they wanted. This program needed to be rerun/restarted if a user entered "invalid" info. Tasks included a data game, basic math game, getting to know a friend conversation, file usage, and list/dictionary creation and data manipulation.

9. Final midterm where a data game was created.
