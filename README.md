# Python for Data Analysis

This includes all my assignments and projects I completed in Python for Data Analysis course by Albany Can Code.

1. Partner collaboration between myself and my classmate having a conversation with each other and outputting the responses in the form of a list.

2. Home practice on operators and math functions.

3. Created a dictionary and manipulated data.

4. Created files and managed data.

5. Created lists and handled data.

6. Developed a math game.

7. Mid review on math functions, python basics, file handling, dictionary, and lists.

8. Final individual review: Built a User Program that created a bunch of options for the user and allowed them to pick what option they wanted. This program needed to be rerun/restarted if a user entered "invalid" info.

    Tasks included:
        1: Data Game
            - Allow the user to pick a min and max number
            - Create a data set (array) within the user's specified range
            - Give the user THREE options of data manipulation (i.e. mean/median/mode/standard dev)
        2: Basic Math Game
            - Reqs: addition, subtraction, square root, division, multiplication, displaying min/max numbers in any given list, manipulating data in other ways from a list
        3: Get to know a friend
            - Audience: working, non-technical professionals
            - Should be a game made for two people to play to get to know a little more about the other
            - Must find a way to learn 10 things about the partner, and save that information into a text file
        4: File Usage!
            - The program must be able to:
                - Create a new empty txt file in the user's directory
                - Add a line of info to the above new file
                - Re-print the contents of the file
                - Add another line to the txt file
                and repeat!
        5: List/Dictionary Creation:
            - Create a list/dictionary of your choice
            - Work with the user to display certain items in the list/dictionary
    
9. Final midterm where a data game was created.
